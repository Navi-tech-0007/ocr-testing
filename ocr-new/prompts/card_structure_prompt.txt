Analyze this Free Fire scoreboard screenshot and identify the card structure.

**PLACEMENT NUMBER APPEARANCE:**
- Each card has a LARGE STYLIZED NUMBER on its LEFT edge
- Placement "1" is in GOLD/YELLOW color (winner)
- Placements 2-12 are in WHITE color
- Numbers are BIG with italic/slanted font, easy to see
- Examples: "1" is gold, "7" is white, "12" is white

**LAYOUT:**
- LEFT column: Cards with placements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (top to bottom)
- RIGHT column: Cards with placements 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (top to bottom)
- Each card is a dark rectangular box with the placement number on its left side

**YOUR TASK:**
For each VISIBLE team card:
1. Find the large placement number (1-12) on the left edge (gold for #1, white for 2-12)
2. Count how many PLAYERS are VISIBLE inside that card's boundary (usually 4, but may be 2 or 3 if cut off)
3. If a card is CUT OFF at top/bottom, count ONLY visible players

**PLAYER ROW LAYOUT:**
Each player row shows:
- Player name (white text on left)
- Orange/yellow kill number (e.g., "4", "0", "7")
- "Eliminations" text (after the kill number)
Example: "SAVA 06⚫   4 Eliminations" means player "SAVA 06⚫" has 4 kills

**COUNTING RULES:**
- Look at the placement number to identify each card
- Count INDIVIDUAL PLAYERS, not rows
- Each card has a 2×2 grid layout:
  - TOP ROW: 2 players (left player + right player)
  - BOTTOM ROW: 2 players (left player + right player)
  - TOTAL: 4 players per full card
- A full card has 4 players visible
- A cut-off card may show only 2 players (one row) or 3 players
- Count each player you can see inside the card boundary
- Do NOT assume 4 if you can only see fewer

CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR RETRY:
1. Each card must be ONE contiguous rectangle—do NOT split a single card into multiple bounding boxes
2. If a card extends beyond the screen edge, clip the bounds to the visible area (don't split it)
3. Cards in the right column are DISTINCT from left column cards—do NOT merge them
4. x1 < x2 and y1 < y2 (left < right, top < bottom)
5. Return ONLY the JSON object in the format specified, with no comments, no text, and no markdown

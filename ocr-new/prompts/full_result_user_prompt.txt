STRICT EXTRACTION RULES:

1. **CARD ISOLATION (CRITICAL - MOST IMPORTANT RULE)**
Each team card is a SEPARATE rectangular box with CLEAR boundaries. Process each card INDEPENDENTLY:
- NEVER EVER mix players between cards
- Each FULL card contains 4 players in a 2×2 grid
- Look at the VISUAL BOUNDARIES of each card rectangle
- A card's boundary is the dark/black rectangular border around it
- If a card is CUT OFF at top/bottom, it may show only 1-3 players
- Players INSIDE a card's boundary belong ONLY to that card
- Players OUTSIDE a card's boundary belong to a DIFFERENT card
- When a card at position 7 is cut off showing 2 players, do NOT take players from position 8
- VERIFY: Does this player's row physically sit inside THIS card's rectangle?

2. **TEAM CARD STRUCTURE**
Each squad card contains:
- Squad/team name (same as first player's clan tag, e.g. "TLx" in TLxNINJA)
- Placement number (large yellow/orange digit on left edge)
- EXACTLY 4 player rows in 2×2 layout:
  - Row 1: slots 1 (left) and 2 (right)
  - Row 2: slots 3 (left) and 4 (right)

3. **PLAYER ROWS**
Each player row contains:
- Player in-game name (white text)
- One orange/yellow kill digit (player kills)
- The kill digit ALWAYS appears right before "Elimina…" or "Eliminations"
- Ignore any white digits inside names—they are NOT kills

4. **COLOR RULES FOR KILLS**
- Player kills: ALWAYS orange or yellow colored digit
- Ignore white numbers—white digits are NOT kills
- Each player has exactly ONE kill number (0-30 range)
- Team total kills: sum of 4 players (0-50 range)

5. **DIGIT VERIFICATION (CRITICAL FOR ACCURACY)**
Carefully distinguish these commonly confused digits:
- **0 vs 8**: 0 has ONE hole, 8 has TWO holes (figure-8 shape)
- **0 vs 6**: 6 has a tail at top-left, 0 is symmetric oval
- **0 vs 9**: 9 has a tail at bottom, 0 is symmetric oval
- **8 vs 6**: 8 has two enclosed loops, 6 has one loop + tail
- **9 vs 2**: 9 has enclosed circle at top, 2 has open curved top
- **1 vs 7**: 7 has horizontal top stroke, 1 is vertical line

When uncertain, examine the digit shape carefully before deciding.

6. **PLACEMENT NUMBER**
The placement is the large number on the LEFT edge of each card.
- **1st place**: Yellow/gold colored digit
- **2nd-12th place**: WHITE colored digits
Extract as: 1 = first place, 2 = second place, etc.

NOTE: Top 3 cards (1st, 2nd, 3rd place) often have a GLARE/SHINE effect.
Still extract them—look carefully through the glare for the placement number and player data.

7. **CARD LAYOUT & PARTIAL CARDS**
The scoreboard has TWO columns:
- **Left column**: ~5-6 cards (placements 1-6)
- **Right column**: ~6-7 cards (placements 7-12)

If 10 or fewer total cards, all are fully visible.
If 12 cards, some may be partially cut off at edges.

**PARTIAL CARD RULES (CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY):**
- If a card is cut off at TOP or BOTTOM, extract ONLY the players INSIDE that card's boundary
- DO NOT assume or guess missing player names or kills
- DO NOT fill in empty slots with data from OTHER cards
- DO NOT "borrow" players from adjacent cards to fill a partial card
- Only include players where you can see BOTH the full name AND full kill count
- If only 1-3 players are visible INSIDE the card boundary, include only those 1-3
- If a player name or kill count is partially cut off, DO NOT include that player
- The placement number on cards is almost ALWAYS visible (99%)
- Keep each card ISOLATED—never mix players from different cards

**EXAMPLE OF CORRECT PARTIAL CARD HANDLING:**
If card at position 7 (right column, top) is cut off at bottom:
- You see: 2 players inside card 7's boundary
- Card 8 below has 4 players in its own boundary
- CORRECT: Card 7 returns 2 players only
- WRONG: Card 7 returns 4 players (taking 2 from card 8)

**HOW TO IDENTIFY CARD BOUNDARIES:**
- Each card has a dark rectangular border
- Cards are stacked vertically in two columns
- The space BETWEEN cards is the boundary separator
- Look for the horizontal gap between cards

8. **OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON ONLY)**

{
  "teams": [
    {
      "card_index": 1,
      "placement": <number>,
      "team_name": "<string>",
      "total_kills": <number>,
      "players": [
        {
          "slot_index": 1,
          "player_name": "<string>",
          "kills": <number>
        },
        {
          "slot_index": 2,
          "player_name": "<string>",
          "kills": <number>
        },
        {
          "slot_index": 3,
          "player_name": "<string>",
          "kills": <number>
        },
        {
          "slot_index": 4,
          "player_name": "<string>",
          "kills": <number>
        }
      ]
    },
    ... (repeat for all VISIBLE teams)
  ]
}

9. **CRITICAL RULES**
- NEVER mix players between cards—each card is ISOLATED in its own rectangle
- Do NOT guess missing names—if unclear, set to empty string ""
- Do NOT output text outside JSON
- Do NOT hallucinate players—extract only VISIBLE players (1-4) per card
- Do NOT reorder teams—use card_index order
- Do NOT invent kill numbers—only extract visible orange digits
- If any kill digit is unclear, set "kills": null
- If team name is unclear, set "team_name": ""
- VERIFY: total_kills should equal SUM of all player kills in that card
- VERIFY: Each player row must be INSIDE the card's visual boundary

10. **VALIDATION**
- Number of teams = number of VISIBLE cards (5-12)
- 1-4 players per team (partial cards may have fewer than 4)
- Placements are numbers (1-12 range)
- Player kills: numbers (0-20) or null
- Team total_kills: numbers (0-50) or null
- All names are strings
- VERIFY: Player belongs to card if their row is INSIDE that card's rectangle
- VERIFY: player1.kills + player2.kills + player3.kills + player4.kills == total_kills

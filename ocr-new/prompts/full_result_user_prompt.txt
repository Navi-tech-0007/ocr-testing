STRICT EXTRACTION RULES:

1. **CARD ISOLATION (CRITICAL)**
Each team card is a SEPARATE rectangular box. Process each card INDEPENDENTLY:
- NEVER mix players between cards
- Each card contains EXACTLY 4 players in a 2×2 grid
- Players in one card belong ONLY to that card
- If you see a player row, identify which card's bounding box contains it

2. **TEAM CARD STRUCTURE**
Each squad card contains:
- Squad/team name (same as first player's clan tag, e.g. "TLx" in TLxNINJA)
- Placement number (large yellow/orange digit on left edge)
- EXACTLY 4 player rows in 2×2 layout:
  - Row 1: slots 1 (left) and 2 (right)
  - Row 2: slots 3 (left) and 4 (right)

3. **PLAYER ROWS**
Each player row contains:
- Player in-game name (white text)
- One orange/yellow kill digit (player kills)
- The kill digit ALWAYS appears right before "Elimina…" or "Eliminations"
- Ignore any white digits inside names—they are NOT kills

4. **COLOR RULES FOR KILLS**
- Player kills: ALWAYS orange or yellow colored digit
- Ignore white numbers—white digits are NOT kills
- Each player has exactly ONE kill number (0-30 range)
- Team total kills: sum of 4 players (0-50 range)

5. **DIGIT VERIFICATION (CRITICAL FOR ACCURACY)**
Carefully distinguish these commonly confused digits:
- **0 vs 8**: 0 has ONE hole, 8 has TWO holes (figure-8 shape)
- **0 vs 6**: 6 has a tail at top-left, 0 is symmetric oval
- **0 vs 9**: 9 has a tail at bottom, 0 is symmetric oval
- **8 vs 6**: 8 has two enclosed loops, 6 has one loop + tail
- **9 vs 2**: 9 has enclosed circle at top, 2 has open curved top
- **1 vs 7**: 7 has horizontal top stroke, 1 is vertical line

When uncertain, examine the digit shape carefully before deciding.

6. **PLACEMENT NUMBER**
The placement is the large number on the LEFT edge of each card.
- **1st place**: Yellow/gold colored digit
- **2nd-12th place**: WHITE colored digits
Extract as: 1 = first place, 2 = second place, etc.

NOTE: Top 3 cards (1st, 2nd, 3rd place) often have a GLARE/SHINE effect.
Still extract them—look carefully through the glare for the placement number and player data.

7. **CARD LAYOUT & PARTIAL CARDS**
The scoreboard has TWO columns:
- **Left column**: ~5-6 cards (placements 1-6)
- **Right column**: ~6-7 cards (placements 7-12)

If 10 or fewer total cards, all are fully visible.
If 12 cards, some may be partially cut off at edges.

**PARTIAL CARD RULES:**
- If a card is cut off and only 2 players are visible, extract ONLY those 2 players
- Set the other 2 player slots to: `{"slot_index": X, "player_name": "", "kills": null}`
- The placement number on cards is almost ALWAYS visible (99%)
- Keep each card ISOLATED—never mix players from different cards

8. **OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON ONLY)**

{
  "teams": [
    {
      "card_index": 1,
      "placement": <number>,
      "team_name": "<string>",
      "total_kills": <number>,
      "players": [
        {
          "slot_index": 1,
          "player_name": "<string>",
          "kills": <number>
        },
        {
          "slot_index": 2,
          "player_name": "<string>",
          "kills": <number>
        },
        {
          "slot_index": 3,
          "player_name": "<string>",
          "kills": <number>
        },
        {
          "slot_index": 4,
          "player_name": "<string>",
          "kills": <number>
        }
      ]
    },
    ... (repeat for all VISIBLE teams)
  ]
}

9. **CRITICAL RULES**
- NEVER mix players between cards—each card is ISOLATED
- Do NOT guess missing names—if unclear, set to empty string ""
- Do NOT output text outside JSON
- Do NOT hallucinate players—extract exactly 4 per card
- Do NOT reorder teams—use card_index order
- Do NOT invent kill numbers—only extract visible orange digits
- If any kill digit is unclear, set "kills": null
- If team name is unclear, set "team_name": ""
- VERIFY: sum of 4 player kills MUST EQUAL total_kills for each team

10. **VALIDATION**
- Number of teams = number of VISIBLE cards (5-12)
- Exactly 4 players per team (2×2 grid)
- Placements are numbers (1-12 range)
- Player kills: numbers (0-20) or null
- Team total_kills: numbers (0-50) or null
- All names are strings
- VERIFY each player belongs to the correct card bounding box
- VERIFY: player1.kills + player2.kills + player3.kills + player4.kills == total_kills

Extract now. Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text.

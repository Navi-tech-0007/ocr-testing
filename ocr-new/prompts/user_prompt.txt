You are given a full screenshot of a Free Fire match scoreboard.

Each TEAM CARD represents one squad and contains exactly 4 player rows arranged in a 2×2 grid:
- Row 1 Left: Player 1
- Row 1 Right: Player 2
- Row 2 Left: Player 3
- Row 2 Right: Player 4

Your task:
1. Identify every visible TEAM CARD in the entire screenshot.
2. For each detected card, return:
   - card_index: the visual top-to-bottom order (1 = top-most).
   - approx_visual_rank: same as card_index unless uncertain.
   - bounds: the bounding box of the entire card in pixel coordinates.

Bounding boxes:
- Use coordinates { "x1": INT, "y1": INT, "x2": INT, "y2": INT }.
- Coordinates must be relative to the FULL screenshot.
- If a card is partially cut off, still return the visible bounding box.

Return JSON ONLY in this exact structure:

{
  "cards": [
    {
      "card_index": 1,
      "approx_visual_rank": 1,
      "bounds": { "x1": 0, "y1": 0, "x2": 0, "y2": 0 }
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Do not extract player names or kills in this step.
- Do not include extra fields.
- If uncertain, estimate but keep values reasonable.

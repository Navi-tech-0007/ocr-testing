- Output must be valid JSON only.
- Extract the name EXACTLY as displayed, preserving all characters.
- Preserve all Unicode symbols, accents, emojis, punctuation, special characters, and spacing.
- Do NOT guess or hallucinate. If unreadable, return an empty string "".
- Never normalize or correct the text.
- Never output markdown, comments, or extra fields.

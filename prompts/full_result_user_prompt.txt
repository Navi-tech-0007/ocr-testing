Extract the ENTIRE match result from this Free Fire scoreboard screenshot.

STRICT EXTRACTION RULES:

1. **TEAM IDENTIFICATION**
Each squad card contains:
- Squad/team name (top-left, white text)
- Placement number (large yellow/orange digit)
- Total kills (orange/yellow number, usually larger)
- Up to 4 player rows

2. **PLAYER ROWS (4 per card)**
Each row contains:
- Player in-game name (white text)
- One orange/yellow kill digit (player kills)
- The kill digit ALWAYS appears right before "Elimina…" or "Eliminations"
- Ignore any white digits inside names—they are NOT kills

3. **COLOR RULES FOR KILLS**
- Player kills: ALWAYS orange or yellow
- Team total kills: Also orange, usually larger/separate
- Ignore white numbers—white digits are NOT kills

4. **PLACEMENT NUMBER**
The placement is the large yellow/orange number inside the card.
Extract as: 1 = first place, 2 = second place, etc.

5. **TEAM ORDERING**
Teams appear EXACTLY in visual order, top-to-bottom, column by column:
- Left column: cards 1–6 (top to bottom)
- Right column: cards 7–12 (top to bottom)

Use the card_index provided to map teams correctly.

6. **OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON ONLY)**

{
  "teams": [
    {
      "card_index": 1,
      "placement": <number>,
      "team_name": "<string>",
      "total_kills": <number>,
      "players": [
        {
          "slot_index": 1,
          "player_name": "<string>",
          "kills": <number>
        },
        {
          "slot_index": 2,
          "player_name": "<string>",
          "kills": <number>
        },
        {
          "slot_index": 3,
          "player_name": "<string>",
          "kills": <number>
        },
        {
          "slot_index": 4,
          "player_name": "<string>",
          "kills": <number>
        }
      ]
    },
    ... (repeat for all 12 teams)
  ]
}

7. **CRITICAL RULES**
- Do NOT guess missing names—if unclear, set to empty string ""
- Do NOT output text outside JSON
- Do NOT hallucinate players—extract exactly 4 per card
- Do NOT reorder teams—use card_index order
- Do NOT invent kill numbers—only extract visible orange digits
- If any kill digit is unclear, set "kills": null
- If team name is unclear, set "team_name": ""

8. **VALIDATION**
- Exactly 12 teams
- Exactly 4 players per team
- All placements 1-12
- All kills are numbers or null
- All names are strings

Extract now. Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text.
